**Project Summary:**
<p>The project meta goal is to make software that is used to test the effectiveness of advertisements that are integrated into video games.  To do this, the researchers have requested a mobile game and a game that can be used with VR. For the research, there needs to be 15 minutes of gameplay with an ad being shown every 3 minutes. It is also required that we implement advertisements for both Coca Cola and Great Value cola so that the research can evaluate if the notoriety of the brand can affect how effective the advertisements are.</p>

**Problem Statment:**
<p>As video games have become a more popular medium of entertainment, there is a large incentive to make games monetizable using advertisements while also keeping the ads as non-intrusive as possible for the sake of the players’ enjoyment.  This makes research into effective in-game ads a very important area of research.  What is desired from the researchers in this case is a game with integrated and aesthetic advertisements for playtesting and research on how effective the in-game ads are.  This game is required to be in both the form of a mobile app and a VR game; VR and mobile gaming are two areas of entertainment that are growing increasingly more popular. The other requirement is that both forms of the game must be able to advertise Coca Cola and Great Value Cola.  These two brands have been chosen by the researchers to represent brands with various levels of notoriety to see how that affects the players’ views towards the advertisements.</p>
